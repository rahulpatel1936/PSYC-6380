<b>Course Assignments for PSYC 6380: Multivariate Statistics in Psychology</b>

<b>Course Description:</b>
The purpose of this course is to give students the conceptual and practical tools they need to 
answer a wide variety of research questions in Psychology using a variety of both parametric 
and non-parametric data analytic techniques. We will be building on concepts and techniques 
taught in _PSYC*6060; and will cover the fundamentals of inferential statistics, data exploration, 
parameter estimation, and model testing and comparison. In addition, we will explore ways to 
become informed, thoughtful, ethical, and skilled users of multivariate statistical techniques. In 
order to do this, emphasis throughout the course will be placed on openness and transparency 
in research, how to avoid questionable research practices, and the crucial distinction between 
exploration and confirmation in data analysis.

In this GitHub repository, you will find code and analyses for various multivariate statistical techniques: correlation, linear regression, mediation, moderation, ANOVA, non-parametric analyses, chi-square, logistic regression, structural equation modeling, and multilevel modeling.

I would like to thank Dr. Scott Cassidy for granting me permission to include these materials in this repository.
